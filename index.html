        <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
        <p>Hi! We're Marble Fox Fursuits, a group of 3 teenagers that make fursuits. We are just starting out, and don't take commissions yet. Right now we are working on our own fursuits so that we can display our works for people to see, and hopefully gain traction over time. </p>
